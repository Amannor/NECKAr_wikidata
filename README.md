# NECKAr_wikidata
## This project has 2 sub-projects, that are in two respective folders:
 - NECKAr_v1.0
     - Note: The interpeter is python 3.8 (due to issues like this one: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70195883)
     - This is a fork from the code of the NECKAr part of the EventAE project. I didn't find an official Github repo to fork from
     - I took the code from: https://event.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/?page_id=532 (Under "Tool")
     - As for mongo - per NECKAr project recommendations, the version that worked for me was 3.2. The only link I could find for it is:  https://mongodb1.software.informer.com/download/#downloading (version 3.2.0, the filename is mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-3.2.0-signed.msi
)
   
 - my_code
     -   My code that calulates stuff (e.g. distributions) based on artifactes generated by the former project
